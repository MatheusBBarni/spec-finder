name: sf-create-prd
description: Creates or updates an approved, human-readable Product Requirements Document through codebase and market research, one-at-a-time clarification, explicit product approach selection, ADR capture, and whole-draft approval. Start from a feature request, a thin or poorly written task, a ticket, an idea, or a packet slug; `_idea.md` is optional. Use `sf-idea-factory` first only when the problem, opportunity, or V1 boundary still needs discovery. After the PRD is saved, run the bundled `humanizer` skill on it. Then hand off to `sf-write-spec`, `sf-tdd-write-spec`, or `sf-create-techspec`. Use for defining product outcomes and requirements, not architecture, spec authoring, task breakdown, or implementation.

# Create a Spec Finder PRD


## Coexistence with specs

This skill and the spec skills are a sequence, not mutually exclusive paths.

1. A thin or poorly written task with little context starts here and becomes `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_prd.md`.
2. After that PRD is approved, the user chooses the next artifact:
   - `sf-write-spec` writes `## Implementation Spec` inside `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_prd.md`, then prints that path.
   - `sf-tdd-write-spec` writes the same heading in the same file, with confirmed public-seam red-green slices, then prints that path.
   - `sf-create-techspec` continues the packet path for `spec-finder run`.
3. This skill does not write the spec. The spec skills preserve approved product sections above `## Implementation Spec`.

<HARD-GATE>
- NEVER require `_idea.md` or prior `sf-idea-factory` completion. Begin directly from a feature request, a thin or poorly written task, a ticket, a prompt, an idea, or a packet slug. Missing product context is resolved by research and clarification, not by refusing the start.
- NEVER write or replace `_prd.md` before both research tracks, clarification, explicit approach selection, a complete draft review, and explicit user approval are complete.
- NEVER skip research or interaction because a feature appears simple, technical, or poorly written.
- NEVER infer a material product decision when multiple credible choices remain.
- NEVER drift into databases, APIs, frameworks, code structure, testing design, or an implementation spec.
- NEVER write `.spec-finder/specs/`, `_techspec.md`, `_tasks.md`, or `task_NN.md`.
- NEVER treat a requested feature or “users want X” as the problem.
- NEVER expand MVP capabilities before explicit non-goals.
- NEVER save a goal without a baseline (or explicit unknown plus how it will be measured), target, window, and measurement method.
- NEVER require section-by-section approval; synthesize one complete draft after the approach decision.
- NEVER choose the next artifact silently. After approval, ask whether to author a normal spec, a TDD spec, or a TechSpec unless the user already named that next skill.
</HARD-GATE>

## Interaction contract

- Ask exactly one question per turn and wait for the answer.
- Use the runtime's blocking question mechanism when available. Otherwise make the question the complete response and stop.
- Present every answer choice with sequential uppercase labels: `A.`, `B.`, `C.`, and so on. Never present selectable answers as unlabeled bullets.
- Every question must provide 2-3 concrete suggested answers. Add `Other` whenever those answers are not exhaustive; lead with `A. (Recommended)` and label `Other` with the next available letter.
- End every choice prompt with: `Reply with the letter (for example, A), or the letter plus context.` Accept lowercase letters and full option text too.
- Ask only product questions about WHAT users need, WHY it matters, WHO needs it, constraints, priority, and measurable success.
- Do not auto-resolve scope, rollout, target-user, capability, or success-metric decisions.

Read `references/question-protocol.md` before asking questions.

## Required inputs

- A feature name, idea, packet slug, or a thin or poorly written task, ticket, or prompt.
- Optional `_idea.md` as primary discovery context when it already exists.
- Optional `_prd.md` for update mode.

A thin task is enough to start. Do not require it to already state the user, failure, success metric, or non-goals. Use `sf-idea-factory` first only when the problem, opportunity, or V1 boundary is still unknown and the user asked for discovery.

## Mandatory phase checklist

1. Resolve the packet and read existing artifacts.
2. Complete codebase and market/user research.
3. Present the evidence summary and research limitations.
4. Ask 3-6 product clarification questions.
5. Present 2-3 product approaches and obtain an explicit selection.
6. Record consequential product decisions in ADRs.
7. Draft the complete PRD and obtain explicit approval.
8. Save the approved PRD, run the bundled `humanizer` skill on that file, re-read, validate, and ask which next artifact to author.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve context

- Derive or confirm the slug and target `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/`.
- Read repository instructions and all existing packet artifacts, including `_idea.md` when present, an existing `_prd.md`, downstream artifacts, and every ADR. Read `.spec-finder/config.json` when present.
- When `_idea.md` exists, treat it as approved input, not immutable truth; surface conflicts with current evidence.
- A thin or poorly written task is a valid start. Do not stop for missing product context before research and clarification.
- New PRDs use `references/prd-template.md`. In update mode, identify the requested delta, preserve untouched sections, and keep the existing document structure. Do not migrate Overview / Core Features / Success Metrics layouts unless the user explicitly asks. The PRD is a living document; change only the approved delta.

### 2. Research before questions

Complete both tracks before asking the user questions. Run them in parallel only when the runtime can do real parallel work.

**Codebase track — required**

- Inspect related user flows, existing behavior, domain language, product constraints, integration boundaries, and tests.
- Cite concrete paths. Do not treat plans, comments, or dead code as shipped behavior.

**Market and user track — required**

- Perform 3-5 current searches across user expectations, comparable products, workflow conventions, adoption evidence, accessibility or compliance expectations, and pricing when relevant.
- Prefer primary and first-party sources. Capture URLs, dates, supported claims, and relevance.
- When `_idea.md` exists, reuse its current sourced research, but refresh claims likely to have changed.

Present:

- **Repository findings** with paths;
- **Sourced external findings** with citations;
- **Inferences** clearly labeled;
- **Unknowns and conflicts** that may require a decision.

If external research is unavailable, disclose the missing evidence and ask with lettered choices whether to proceed with a research-limited PRD, wait, or provide another direction. Do not silently downgrade the hard gate.

### 3. Clarify the product need

- Ask 3-6 questions following `references/question-protocol.md`.
- Follow the protocol order: need, users, testable success, non-goals and scope, then capabilities.
- Restate the problem from evidence (who, current workflow, failure, cost). A feature request is not a problem.
- Do not ask questions already answered by approved artifacts or research unless evidence conflicts.
- Translate technical-sounding requests into user outcomes. Ask which events need notification, not whether to use polling; ask what export users need, not which library to use.

### 4. Present product approaches

- Offer 2-3 meaningfully different approaches in scope, phasing, workflow, or strategy, labeled `A.`, `B.`, and `C.` in presentation order; label another direction with the next letter.
- For each state: included capability, excluded capability, user value, principal risk, evidence, and reversibility.
- Recommend the smallest credible option that satisfies the verified need and name what it gives up.
- Wait for explicit selection. If evidence is insufficient to recommend, say so and present the missing decision as lettered answers rather than an open-ended prompt.

### 5. Record decisions

- Read `references/adr-template.md`.
- Create the next zero-padded ADR only after the user selects an approach.
- Record the decision, alternatives, evidence, consequences, and risks. Do not label an inferred preference `Accepted`.
- Create additional ADRs only for consequential scope, rollout, or policy decisions.

### 6. Draft the complete PRD

- Read `references/prd-template.md` and fill every mandatory section in this order: Problem and Evidence, Goals, Out of Scope, In Scope, User Stories, Constraints, Risks, ADRs, Open Questions.
- Target 800–1600 words. Cut anything that does not change a decision. Evidence is at most 8 decision-changing rows; if `_idea.md` exists, synthesize it rather than duplicating the ledger.
- Problem first: who, current workflow, failure, and cost, with evidence. Do not lead with features.
- Write Out of Scope before In Scope and before extra capabilities. Later phases belong in Out of Scope with a promotion trigger.
- Apply YAGNI: every in-scope `F-xx` must trace to a verified user need or goal.
- Use stable IDs so the TechSpec can trace them: `G-xx` (goals are the metrics), `US-xx`, `F-xx`. Add `M-xx` only when one goal needs more than one metric.
- Every `US-xx` uses Given/When/Then for observable product behavior, not implementation steps. Empty, failure, recovery, and accessibility paths are extra GWT triples, not a UX essay.
- Keep `F-xx` as a thin capability table. Do not write MUST/SHOULD feature specs.
- Put unresolved non-blocking items in Open Questions and explicitly exclude deferred work.
- Cite market claims near their source. Label estimates and inference. Never invent a baseline.
- Write simple sentences a person can read aloud. Do not use promotional language, inflated significance, or chatbot phrasing. The post-save `humanizer` pass is still required.

### 7. Review and save

- Present one complete draft and ask with `A. Approve`, `B. Adjust`, `C. Rewrite`, and `D. Discard`.
- Apply requested changes and present the complete current draft again.
- Write `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_prd.md` only after explicit approval of that version.
- Re-read the saved file and validate:
  - the problem is evidenced and is not a feature request;
  - every `G-xx` has baseline (or explicit unknown plus measurement plan), target, window, and method;
  - Out of Scope exists and is not contradicted by In Scope;
  - every `US-xx` has Given/When/Then;
  - every `F-xx` maps to a goal or story and states an observable outcome, not a design;
  - no APIs, frameworks, schema, or testing design;
  - Evidence is capped, cited, and distinguished from inference;
  - ADRs are linked and no material branch sits in Open Questions;
  - length is in the 800–1600 word target unless the user approved a longer delta.
- After validation, run the bundled `humanizer` skill on the saved `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_prd.md` before asking what comes next.
- Read `humanizer` from the Spec Finder skills installed beside this skill, or from `skills/humanizer/SKILL.md` in the Spec Finder package. If neither file is readable, stop and tell the user to install `humanizer` with `spec-finder setup`. Do not invent a partial rewrite.
- Rewrite the saved PRD with that skill so the prose is simple and human-readable. Preserve product decisions, stable IDs (`G-xx`, `US-xx`, `F-xx`), Given/When/Then, tables, citations, required headings, and approved scope.
- Do not add first-person opinions, humor, or new claims. A PRD stays neutral product writing. Use the humanizer to remove AI patterns, not to turn the document into an essay.
- If humanizing would drop a required ID, table, citation, or decision, restore that fact in plain language and humanize the surrounding prose again.
- Re-read the humanized file and repeat the validation list above. Do not ask the next-artifact question until that file passes.
- If the user already named the next skill, point to that skill and the PRD path. Do not write the next artifact.
- Otherwise ask exactly once:

```text
The approved PRD is `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_prd.md`.
Which artifact should be authored next from this PRD?

A. (Recommended) Normal spec with `sf-write-spec` — `## Implementation Spec` inside `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_prd.md`. That skill prints the path to paste to an agent.
B. TDD spec with `sf-tdd-write-spec` — same file and heading, with confirmed public-seam red-green slices. That skill prints the path.
C. Packet TechSpec with `sf-create-techspec` — `.spec-finder/tasks/<slug>/_techspec.md`, then tasks and `spec-finder run`.
D. Stop here.

Reply with the letter (for example, A), or the letter plus context.
```

- Recommend A unless the user already asked for TDD or the packet runner.
- Do not start spec research, seam confirmation, or TechSpec design in this skill.

## Anti-patterns

- Calling assumptions “research”.
- Asking the user to decide facts discoverable from the repository or current sources.
- Offering approaches that differ only in implementation technology.
- Treating “users want X” or a solution as the problem.
- Drafting features before non-goals.
- Untestable goals or invented baselines.
- MUST/SHOULD or UX essays that belong in the TechSpec.
- Dumping the full research ledger into Evidence.
- Treating “nice to have” as MVP without a mapped goal or story.
- Hiding unresolved scope inside vague language such as “support common cases”.
- Refusing a thin task before research and clarification.
- Writing the spec, TechSpec, or tasks from this skill.
- Treating `sf-write-spec` or `sf-tdd-write-spec` as a replacement for this PRD when the task lacks product context.
- Saving a PRD that still reads like AI copy, or skipping the `humanizer` pass.
- Letting `humanizer` drop IDs, tables, citations, or approved product decisions.

## Failure rules

- Stop if both the requested outcome and target user remain unclear after clarification.
- Stop if success cannot be stated with a target, window, and measurement method after clarification.
- If research contradicts an existing `_idea.md`, present the conflict and ask with lettered choices whether current evidence, the approved idea, or another direction governs before drafting.
- If a material decision remains open, do not move it silently into Open Questions and save anyway.
- Preserve unrelated approved content in update mode.
