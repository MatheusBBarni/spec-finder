# Write-spec question protocol

Use this protocol only after repository and current-docs research.

## Remaining-decision order

Ask only dimensions still open after research and existing artifacts:

1. **Need and success** if the problem, primary user, or testable success is still open.
2. **Non-goals and MVP boundary** if exclusions are not explicit.
3. **Public contracts and failure** if signatures, errors, or recovery still fork.
4. **Boundaries** if Always / Ask first / Never cannot be written from evidence.
5. **Slice or sequencing** only when a split would change user-visible outcomes.

Skip a dimension that research, the request, or an approved artifact already fixed.
Do not manufacture questions to reach a quota.
Ask 2-6 remaining questions.
If none remain, present the complete draft.

## Rules

- Ask exactly one question per turn and wait.
- Use the host's blocking question tool when available; otherwise stop after the question.
- Give every selectable answer an uppercase sequential label: `A.`, `B.`, `C.`, and so on.
- Every question must provide 2-3 evidence-backed answers.
  Add `Other` whenever those answers are not exhaustive and label it with the next available letter.
- Put the recommendation first as `A. (Recommended) [answer] - [principal trade-off]`.
- End every prompt with `Reply with the letter (for example, A), or the letter plus context.`
- Accept uppercase or lowercase letters, letter-plus-context, and full option text.
- Never use unlabeled bullets, positional phrases such as "the second option", or bare yes/no approval prompts.
- Do not ask the user to choose facts the repository or current docs already answer.
- Do not auto-resolve a decision that changes scope, public contracts, data ownership, security, migrations, or required evidence.

## Required shape

```text
[One remaining decision, with the evidence that left it open]

A. (Recommended) [Answer] - [principal trade-off]
B. [Answer] - [principal trade-off]
C. [Answer] - [principal trade-off]
D. Other - describe a different answer.

Reply with the letter (for example, A), or the letter plus context.
```

Use only as many labeled choices as the decision needs.
For a binary decision, use `A.` and `B.`; add `C. Other` when another answer is meaningful.

For whole-draft approval:

```text
A. Approve and write the packet
B. Adjust the draft
C. Rewrite
D. Discard
```

## Translation

- Replace "WebSockets or polling?" with "Which events must appear immediately?"
- Replace "Which library?" with "Which existing module should this follow, and what public contract changes?"
- Replace "How should we split the work?" with "Which user/operator outcome must ship first?"
